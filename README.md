**Use the "Learning Moments" boxes** - When you see those yellow sticky note callouts and "Watch it!" warnings, jot down just the core concept in 5-7 words max.
**Focus on syntax patterns** - Since this chapter introduces function syntax, enum cases, and associated values, create tiny code snippets rather than explanations. Write the pattern once, not the full explanation.
**Track the "Brain Power" exercises** - These usually appear mid-page. Instead of copying the question, write your one-sentence answer or realization.
**Note the "there are no Dumb Questions" sections** - Pick one key clarification from each Q&A that you didn't know before.
**Use the Sharpen Your Pencil solutions** - Don't copy the code, just note what concept it reinforced (like "enums can have raw values" or "functions can return tuples").
**Mark the Fireside Chat** - If there's a dialogue between concepts in this chapter, capture just the main distinction being made.
**Focus on the incomplete code examples** - Where they show partial code and ask you to think about what's missing, write down what you figured out before seeing the answer.

---
**"Learning Moments" boxes example:**
Instead of: "Functions help organize code and make it reusable by encapsulating behavior..."
Write: "Functions = reusable code blocks"

**Syntax patterns example:**
Instead of explaining parameter labels, just write:
```
func greet(name: String) -> String
func move(from: Point, to: Point)
```

**"Brain Power" exercises example:**
When they ask "What happens if you don't provide a return type?"
Write: "No return type = Void function" (not the full explanation)

**"No Dumb Questions" example:**
From a typical Q&A like "Q: Can enums have methods? A: Yes, enums can have computed properties and methods..."
Write: "Enums can have methods"

**Sharpen Your Pencil example:**
After completing an exercise about enum associated values:
Write: "Associated values store different data per case"
(Don't copy `Color.rgb(Int, Int, Int) example)`)

**Fireside Chat example:**
If there's a dialogue between "Function" and "Method":
Write: "Functions standalone, methods belong to types"

**Incomplete code example:**
When they show enum Direction { case north, south } and ask what's missing for raw values:
Write: "Raw values need explicit type declaration"
